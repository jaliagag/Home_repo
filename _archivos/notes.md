Cutting down on Capex and time to market

Hybrid cloud

- SAAS --> office 365. no need to install anything on your machine, Browser interface.
- PAAS --> no need to worry about the backend system, the infrastructure, the hardware...
- IAAS --> servers, firewalls, backup... administered by you. GUI or CLI. Relies on virtualization. Provision

## 5 characteristics of cloud computing

1. On demand self service: create services whenever you want.
2. broad network access: access must be available from everywhere.
3. resource pooling: sharing resources within the physical server.
4. rapid elasticity: increase capacity automatically as demand increases. Decrease automatically as well. Horizontal escaling (provisioning new servers);
Vertical escaling: shutdown the server, increase some hardware component (RAM, CPU...).
5. measured service (pay as you go model)
